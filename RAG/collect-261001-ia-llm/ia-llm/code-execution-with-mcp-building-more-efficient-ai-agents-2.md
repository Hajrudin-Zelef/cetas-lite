# code-execution-with-mcp-building-more-efficient-ai-agents

Loops, conditionals, and error handling can be done with familiar code patterns rather than chaining individual tool calls. For example, if you need a deployment notification in Slack, the agent can write:

```
let found = false;
while (!found) {
  const messages = await slack.getChannelHistory({ channel: 'C123456' });
  found = messages.some(m => m.text.includes('deployment complete'));
  if (!found) await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 5000));
}
console.log('Deployment notification received');
```
This approach is more efficient than alternating between MCP tool calls and sleep commands through the agent loop.

Additionally, being able to write out a conditional tree that gets executed also saves on “time to first token” latency: rather than having to wait for a model to evaluate an if-statement, the agent can let the code execution environment do this.

When agents use code execution with MCP, intermediate results stay in the execution environment by default. This way, the agent only sees what you explicitly log or return, meaning data you don’t wish to share with the model can flow through your workflow without ever entering the model's context.

For even more sensitive workloads, the agent harness can tokenize sensitive data automatically. For example, imagine you need to import customer contact details from a spreadsheet into Salesforce. The agent writes:

```
const sheet = await gdrive.getSheet({ sheetId: 'abc123' });
for (const row of sheet.rows) {
  await salesforce.updateRecord({
    objectType: 'Lead',
    recordId: row.salesforceId,
    data: { 
      Email: row.email,
      Phone: row.phone,
      Name: row.name
    }
  });
}
console.log(`Updated ${sheet.rows.length} leads`);
```
The MCP client intercepts the data and tokenizes PII before it reaches the model:

```
// What the agent would see, if it logged the sheet.rows:
[
  { salesforceId: '00Q...', email: '[EMAIL_1]', phone: '[PHONE_1]', name: '[NAME_1]' },
  { salesforceId: '00Q...', email: '[EMAIL_2]', phone: '[PHONE_2]', name: '[NAME_2]' },
  ...
]
```
Then, when the data is shared in another MCP tool call, it is untokenized via a lookup in the MCP client. The real email addresses, phone numbers, and names flow from Google Sheets to Salesforce, but never through the model. This prevents the agent from accidentally logging or processing sensitive data. You can also use this to define deterministic security rules, choosing where data can flow to and from.

Code execution with filesystem access allows agents to maintain state across operations. Agents can write intermediate results to files, enabling them to resume work and track progress:

```
const leads = await salesforce.query({ 
  query: 'SELECT Id, Email FROM Lead LIMIT 1000' 
});
const csvData = leads.map(l => `${l.Id},${l.Email}`).join('\n');
await fs.writeFile('./workspace/leads.csv', csvData);
// Later execution picks up where it left off
const saved = await fs.readFile('./workspace/leads.csv', 'utf-8');
```
Agents can also persist their own code as reusable functions. Once an agent develops working code for a task, it can save that implementation for future use:

```
// In ./skills/save-sheet-as-csv.ts
import * as gdrive from './servers/google-drive';
export async function saveSheetAsCsv(sheetId: string) {
  const data = await gdrive.getSheet({ sheetId });
  const csv = data.map(row => row.join(',')).join('\n');
  await fs.writeFile(`./workspace/sheet-${sheetId}.csv`, csv);
  return `./workspace/sheet-${sheetId}.csv`;
}
// Later, in any agent execution:
import { saveSheetAsCsv } from './skills/save-sheet-as-csv';
const csvPath = await saveSheetAsCsv('abc123');
```
This ties in closely to the concept of Skills, folders of reusable instructions, scripts, and resources for models to improve performance on specialized tasks. Adding a SKILL.md file to these saved functions creates a structured skill that models can reference and use. Over time, this allows your agent to build a toolbox of higher-level capabilities, evolving the scaffolding that it needs to work most effectively.

Note that code execution introduces its own complexity. Running agent-generated code requires a secure execution environment with appropriate sandboxing, resource limits, and monitoring. These infrastructure requirements add operational overhead and security considerations that direct tool calls avoid. The benefits of code execution—reduced token costs, lower latency, and improved tool composition—should be weighed against these implementation costs.

MCP provides a foundational protocol for agents to connect to many tools and systems. However, once too many servers are connected, tool definitions and results can consume excessive tokens, reducing agent efficiency.

Although many of the problems here feel novel—context management, tool composition, state persistence—they have known solutions from software engineering. Code execution applies these established patterns to agents, letting them use familiar programming constructs to interact with MCP servers more efficiently. If you implement this approach, we encourage you to share your findings with the MCP community.
