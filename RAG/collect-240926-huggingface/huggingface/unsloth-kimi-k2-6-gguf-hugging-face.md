# Read our How to Run Kimi K2.6 Guide!

    *See Unsloth Dynamic 2.0 GGUFs for our quantization benchmarks.*
  

- To run Kimi K2.6 in full precision lossless, run Q8 (UD-Q8_K_XL), which is 595GB and only 10GB bigger than Q4 (UD-Q4_K_XL).
- See our Kimi K2.6 guide for quantization analysis and instructions.

Kimi K2.6 is an open-source, native multimodal agentic model that advances practical capabilities in long-horizon coding, coding-driven design, proactive autonomous execution, and swarm-based task orchestration.

- **Long-Horizon Coding** : K2.6 achieves significant improvements on complex, end-to-end coding tasks, generalizing robustly across programming languages (Rust, Go, Python) and domains spanning front-end, DevOps, and performance optimization.
- **Coding-Driven Design** : K2.6 is capable of transforming simple prompts and visual inputs into production-ready interfaces and lightweight full-stack workflows, generating structured layouts, interactive elements, and rich animations with deliberate aesthetic precision.
- **Elevated Agent Swarm** : Scaling horizontally to 300 sub-agents executing 4,000 coordinated steps, K2.6 can dynamically decompose tasks into parallel, domain-specialized subtasks, delivering end-to-end outputs from documents to websites to spreadsheets in a single autonomous run.
- **Proactive & Open Orchestration** : For autonomous tasks, K2.6 demonstrates strong performance in powering persistent, 24/7 background agents that proactively manage schedules, execute code, and orchestrate cross-platform operations without human oversight.

## **Footnotes**

1. **General Testing Details**
  - We report results for Kimi K2.6 and Kimi K2.5 with thinking mode enabled, Claude Opus 4.6 with max effort, GPT-5.4 with xhigh reasoning effort, and Gemini 3.1 Pro with a high thinking level.
  - Unless otherwise specified, all Kimi K2.6 experiments were conducted with temperature = 1.0, top-p = 1.0, and a context length of 262,144 tokens.
  - Benchmarks without publicly available scores were re-evaluated under the same conditions used for Kimi K2.6 and are marked with an asterisk (`*` ). Except where noted with an asterisk, all other results are cited from official reports.
2. **Reasoning Benchmarks**
  - IMO-AnswerBench scores for GPT-5.4 and Claude 4.6 were obtained from z.ai/blog/glm-5.1.
  - Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) and other reasoning tasks were evaluated with a maximum generation length of 98,304 tokens. By default, we report results on the HLE full set. For the text-only subset, Kimi K2.6 achieves 36.4% accuracy without tools and 55.5% with tools.
3. **Tool-Augmented / Agentic Tasks**
  - Kimi K2.6 was equipped with search, code-interpreter, and web-browsing tools for HLE with tools, BrowseComp, DeepSearchQA, and WideSearch.
  - For HLE-Full with tools, the maximum generation length is 262,144 tokens with a per-step limit of 49,152 tokens. We employ a simple context management strategy: once the context window exceeds the threshold, only the most recent round of tool-related messages is retained.
  - For BrowseComp, we report scores obtained with context management using the same discard-all strategy as Kimi K2.5 and DeepSeek-V3.2.
  - For DeepSearchQA, no context management was applied to Kimi K2.6 tests, and tasks exceeding the supported context length were directly counted as failed. Scores for Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.4, and Gemini 3.1 Pro on DeepSearchQA are cited from the Claude Opus 4.7 System Card.
  - For WideSearch, we report results under the "hide tool result" context management setting. Once the context window exceeds the threshold, only the most recent round of tool-related messages is retained.
  - The test system prompts are identical to those used in the Kimi K2.5 technical report.
  - Claw Eval was conducted using version 1.1 with max-tokens-per-step = 16384.
  - For APEX-Agents, we evaluate 452 tasks from the public 480-task release, as done by Artificial Analysis(excluding Investment Banking Worlds 244 and 246, which have external runtime dependencies)
4. **Coding Tasks**
  - Terminal-Bench 2.0 scores were obtained with the default agent framework (Terminus-2) and the provided JSON parser, operating in preserve thinking mode.
  - For the SWE-Bench series of evaluations (including Verified, Multilingual, and Pro), we used an in-house evaluation framework adapted from SWE-agent. This framework includes a minimal set of tools—bash tool, createfile tool, insert tool, view tool, strreplace tool, and submit tool.
  - All reported scores for coding tasks are averaged over 10 independent runs.
5. **Vision Benchmarks**
  - Max-tokens = 98,304, averaged over three runs (avg@3).
  - Settings with Python tool use max-tokens-per-step = 65,536 and max-steps = 50 for multi-step reasoning.
  - MMMU-Pro follows the official protocol, preserving input order and prepending images.

Kimi-K2.6 adopts the same native int4 quantization method as Kimi-K2-Thinking.

You can access Kimi-K2.6's API on https://platform.moonshot.ai and we provide OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible API for you. To verify the deployment is correct, we also provide the Kimi Vendor Verifier. Currently, Kimi-K2.6 is recommended to run on the following inference engines:


- vLLM
- SGLang
- KTransformers

Kimi-K2.6 has the same architecture as Kimi-K2.5, and the deployment method can be directly reused.

The version requirement for `transformers` is `>=4.57.1, <5.0.0`.

Deployment examples can be found in the Model Deployment Guide.

The usage demos below demonstrate how to call our official API.

For third-party APIs deployed with vLLM or SGLang, please note that:


The recommended `temperature` will be `1.0` for Thinking mode and `0.6` for Instant mode.

The recommended `top_p` is `0.95`.

To use instant mode, you need to pass `{'chat_template_kwargs': {"thinking": False}}` in `extra_body`.


This is a simple chat completion script which shows how to call K2.6 API in Thinking and Instant modes.

```
import openai
import base64
import requests
def simple_chat(client: openai.OpenAI, model_name: str):
    messages = [
        {'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are Kimi, an AI assistant created by Moonshot AI.'},
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': [
                {'type': 'text', 'text': 'which one is bigger, 9.11 or 9.9? think carefully.'}
            ],
        },
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name, messages=messages, stream=False, max_tokens=4096
    )
    print('====== Below is reasoning content in Thinking Mode ======')
    print(f'reasoning content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning}')
    print('====== Below is response in Thinking Mode ======')
    print(f'response: {response.choices[0].message.content}')
    # To use instant mode, pass {"thinking" = {"type":"disabled"}}
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name,
        messages=messages,
        stream=False,
        max_tokens=4096,
        extra_body={'thinking': {'type': 'disabled'}},  # this is for official API
        # extra_body= {'chat_template_kwargs': {"thinking": False}}  # this is for vLLM/SGLang
    )
    print('====== Below is response in Instant Mode ======')
    print(f'response: {response.choices[0].message.content}')
```
K2.6 supports Image and Video input.

The following example demonstrates how to call K2.6 API with image input:

```
import openai
import base64
import requests
def chat_with_image(client: openai.OpenAI, model_name: str):
    url = 'https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6/resolve/main/figures/kimi-logo.png'
    image_base64 = base64.b64encode(requests.get(url).content).decode()
    messages = [
        {
            'role': 'user',
            'content': [
                {'type': 'text', 'text': 'Describe this image in detail.'},
                {
                    'type': 'image_url',
                    'image_url': {'url': f'data:image/png;base64, {image_base64}'},
                },
            ],
        }
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name, messages=messages, stream=False, max_tokens=8192
    )
    print('====== Below is reasoning content in Thinking Mode ======')
    print(f'reasoning content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning}')
    print('====== Below is response in Thinking Mode ======')
    print(f'response: {response.choices[0].message.content}')
    # Also support instant mode if you pass {"thinking" = {"type":"disabled"}}
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name,
        messages=messages,
        stream=False,
        max_tokens=4096,
        extra_body={'thinking': {'type': 'disabled'}},  # this is for official API
        # extra_body= {'chat_template_kwargs': {"thinking": False}}  # this is for vLLM/SGLang
    )
    print('====== Below is response in Instant Mode ======')
    print(f'response: {response.choices[0].message.content}')
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```
The following example demonstrates how to call K2.6 API with video input:

```
import openai
import base64
import requests
def chat_with_video(client: openai.OpenAI, model_name:str):
    url = 'https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6/resolve/main/figures/demo_video.mp4'
    video_base64 = base64.b64encode(requests.get(url).content).decode()
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text","text": "Describe the video in detail."},
                {
                    "type": "video_url",
                    "video_url": {"url": f"data:video/mp4;base64,{video_base64}"},
                },
            ],
        }
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(model=model_name, messages=messages)
    print('====== Below is reasoning content in Thinking Mode ======')
    print(f'reasoning content: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning}')
    print('====== Below is response in Thinking Mode ======')
    print(f'response: {response.choices[0].message.content}')
    # Also support instant mode if pass {"thinking" = {"type":"disabled"}}
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name,
        messages=messages,
        stream=False,
        max_tokens=4096,
        extra_body={'thinking': {'type': 'disabled'}},  # this is for official API
        # extra_body= {'chat_template_kwargs': {"thinking": False}}  # this is for vLLM/SGLang
    )
    print('====== Below is response in Instant Mode ======')
    print(f'response: {response.choices[0].message.content}')
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```
Kimi K2.6 supports `preserve_thinking` mode, which retains full reasoning content across multi-turn interactions and enhances performance in coding agent scenarios.

This feature is disabled by default. The following example demonstrates how to call K2.6 API in `preserve_thinking` mode:

```
def chat_with_preserve_thinking(client: openai.OpenAI, model_name: str):
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Tell me three random numbers."
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "reasoning_content": "I'll start by listing five numbers: 473, 921, 235, 215, 222, and I'll tell you the first three.",
            "content": "473, 921, 235"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What are the other two numbers you have in mind?"
        }
    ]
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model_name,
        messages=messages,
        stream=False,
        max_tokens=4096,
        extra_body={'thinking': {'type': 'enabled', 'keep': 'all'}},  # this is for official API
        # extra_body={"chat_template_kwargs": {"thinking":True, "preserve_thinking": True}},  # this is for vLLM/SGLang
        # We recommend enabling preserve_thinking only in think mode.
    )
    # the assistant should mention 215 and 222 that appear in the prior reasoning content
    print(f"response: {response.choices[0].message.reasoning}")
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```
K2.6 shares the same design of Interleaved Thinking and Multi-Step Tool Call as K2 Thinking. For usage example, please refer to the K2 Thinking documentation.
