For `Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B/0.6B-CustomVoice` models, the supported speaker list and speaker descriptions are provided below. We recommend using each speaker’s native language for the best quality. Of course, each speaker can speak any language supported by the model.

| Speaker | Voice Description | Native language | 
|---|---|---|
| Vivian | Bright, slightly edgy young female voice. | Chinese | 
| Serena | Warm, gentle young female voice. | Chinese | 
| Uncle_Fu | Seasoned male voice with a low, mellow timbre. | Chinese | 
| Dylan | Youthful Beijing male voice with a clear, natural timbre. | Chinese (Beijing Dialect) | 
| Eric | Lively Chengdu male voice with a slightly husky brightness. | Chinese (Sichuan Dialect) | 
| Ryan | Dynamic male voice with strong rhythmic drive. | English | 
| Aiden | Sunny American male voice with a clear midrange. | English | 
| Ono_Anna | Playful Japanese female voice with a light, nimble timbre. | Japanese | 
| Sohee | Warm Korean female voice with rich emotion. | Korean | 

For the voice design model (`Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign`), you can use `generate_voice_design` to provide the target text and a natural-language `instruct` description.

# batch inference

      "哥哥，你回来啦，人家等了你好久好久了，要抱抱！",
      "It's in the top drawer... wait, it's empty? No way, that's impossible! I'm sure I put it there!"
    ],

      "体现撒娇稚嫩的萝莉女声，音调偏高且起伏明显，营造出黏人、做作又刻意卖萌的听觉效果。",

For the voice clone model (`Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B/0.6B-Base`), to clone a voice and synthesize new content, you just need to provide a reference audio clip (`ref_audio`) along with its transcript (`ref_text`). `ref_audio` can be a local file path, a URL, a base64 string, or a `(numpy_array, sample_rate)` tuple. If you set `x_vector_only_mode=True`, only the speaker embedding is used so `ref_text` is not required, but cloning quality may be reduced.

```
import torch
import soundfile as sf
from qwen_tts import Qwen3TTSModel
model = Qwen3TTSModel.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base",
    device_map="cuda:0",
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)
ref_audio = "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-TTS-Repo/clone.wav"
ref_text  = "Okay. Yeah. I resent you. I love you. I respect you. But you know what? You blew it! And thanks to you."
wavs, sr = model.generate_voice_clone(
    text="I am solving the equation: x = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a? Nobody can — it's a disaster (◍•͈⌔•͈◍), very sad!",
    language="English",
    ref_audio=ref_audio,
    ref_text=ref_text,
)
sf.write("output_voice_clone.wav", wavs[0], sr)
```
If you need to reuse the same reference prompt across multiple generations (to avoid recomputing prompt features), build it once with `create_voice_clone_prompt` and pass it via `voice_clone_prompt`.

```
prompt_items = model.create_voice_clone_prompt(
    ref_audio=ref_audio,
    ref_text=ref_text,
    x_vector_only_mode=False,
)
wavs, sr = model.generate_voice_clone(
    text=["Sentence A.", "Sentence B."],
    language=["English", "English"],
    voice_clone_prompt=prompt_items,
)
sf.write("output_voice_clone_1.wav", wavs[0], sr)
sf.write("output_voice_clone_2.wav", wavs[1], sr)
```
For more examples of reusable voice clone prompts, batch cloning, and batch inference, please refer to the example codes. With those examples and the `generate_voice_clone` function description, you can explore more advanced usage patterns.

If you want a designed voice that you can reuse like a cloned speaker, a practical workflow is: (1) use the **VoiceDesign** model to synthesize a short reference clip that matches your target persona, (2) feed that clip into `create_voice_clone_prompt` to build a reusable prompt, and then (3) call `generate_voice_clone` with `voice_clone_prompt` to generate new content without re-extracting features every time. This is especially useful when you want a consistent character voice across many lines.
