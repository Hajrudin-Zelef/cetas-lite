All evaluation results were collected via Nemo Evaluator SDK and for most benchmarks, the Nemo Skills Harness. For reproducibility purposes, more details on the evaluation settings can be found in the Nemo Evaluator SDK configs folder and the reproducibility tutorial for Nemotron 3 Super. The open source container on Nemo Skills packaged via NVIDIA's Nemo Evaluator SDK used for evaluations can be found here. In addition to Nemo Skills, the evaluations also used dedicated open-source packaged containers for Tau-2 Bench (default prompt), Terminal Bench Hard (48 tasks), ScaleAI Multi Challenge Multi-turn Instruction Following, and Ruler.

The following benchmarks are not onboarded yet in our open source tools and for these we used either their official open source implementation or otherwise an internal scaffolding that we plan to open source in the future: SWE Bench Verified (OpenHands), SWE Bench Multilingual (OpenHands), BrowseComp with Search (internal implementation with Serp API), Terminal Bench Core 2.0 (Harbor).

NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16 is a general purpose reasoning and chat model intended to be used in English, Code, and supported multilingual contexts. This model is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads. It is intended to be used by developers designing AI Agent systems, chatbots, RAG systems, and other AI-powered applications. This model is also suitable for complex instruction-following tasks and long-context reasoning.

Hugging Face - 03/11/2026 via Hugging Face

- **Architecture Type:** Mamba2-Transformer Hybrid Latent Mixture of Experts (LatentMoE) with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)
- **Network Architecture:** Nemotron Hybrid LatentMoE
- **Number of model parameters:** 120B Total / 12B Active

The model utilizes the **LatentMoE** architecture, where tokens are projected into a smaller latent dimension for expert routing and computation, improving accuracy per byte. The Super model is pre-trained using NVFP4 quantization — the first model in the Nemotron 3 family trained at this precision. The majority of linear layers use NVFP4 for weights, activations, and gradients, while select layers (including latent projections, MTP layers, QKV/attention projections, and embeddings) are maintained in BF16 or MXFP8 for training stability. The model includes **Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)** layers using a shared-weight design across prediction heads. This improves training signal quality, enables faster inference via native speculative decoding, and supports more stable autoregressive drafting at longer draft lengths compared to independently trained offset heads.

Stage 1: Pre-Training

- NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-Base-BF16 model was pre-trained for over 25T tokens using crawled and synthetic code, math, science, and general knowledge data. Training leveraged NVFP4 quantization for efficiency. All datasets are disclosed in the Training and Evaluation Datasets section of this document. Major portions of the pre-training corpus are released in the Nemotron-Pre-Training-Datasets collection.
- Software used for pre-training: Megatron-LM

Stage 2: Supervised Fine-Tuning

- The model was further fine-tuned on synthetic code, math, science, tool calling, instruction following, structured outputs, and general knowledge data. This stage incorporated data designed to support long-range retrieval and multi-document aggregation. All datasets are disclosed in the Training and Evaluation Datasets section of this document. Major portions of the fine-tuning corpus are released in the Nemotron-Post-Training-v3 collection. Data Designer is one of the libraries used to prepare these corpora.

Stage 3: Reinforcement Learning

- The model underwent multi-environment reinforcement learning using asynchronous GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) across math, code, science, instruction following, multi-step tool use, multi-turn conversations, and structured output environments. It utilized an asynchronous RL architecture that fully decouples training from inference across separate GPU devices, leveraging in-flight weight updates and MTP to accelerate rollout generation. Conversational quality was further refined through RLHF. All datasets are disclosed in the *Training and Evaluation Datasets* section of this document. The RL environments and datasets are released as part of NeMo Gym.
- Software used for reinforcement learning: NeMo RL, NeMo Gym

NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16 model is a result of the above work.

The end-to-end training recipe is available in the NVIDIA Nemotron Developer Repository. Evaluation results can be replicated using the NeMo Evaluator SDK. Data Designer is one of the libraries used to prepare the pre and post training datasets. More details on the datasets and synthetic data generation methods can be found in the technical report NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Super Technical Report.

The examples below use the OpenAI-compatible client and work with any of the serving backends above.

NOTE: For coding agents add the following to the API call - `extra_body={“chat_template_kwargs”: {“force_nonempty_content”: True}`


```
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="EMPTY")
MODEL = "nvidia/nemotron-3-super"
```
**Reasoning ON (default)**

```
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about GPUs"}],
    max_tokens=16000,
    temperature=1.0,
    top_p=0.95,
    extra_body={"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": True}}
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
**Reasoning OFF**

```
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"}],
    max_tokens=16000,
    temperature=1.0,
    top_p=0.95,
    extra_body={"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": False}}
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
**Low-effort reasoning**

Uses significantly fewer reasoning tokens than full thinking mode. Recommended as a starting point before tuning explicit token budgets.

```
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of Japan?"}],
    max_tokens=16000,
    temperature=1.0,

```
OpenCode is an AI coding agent that runs in your terminal. It connects to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, making it compatible with all three serving backends above (vLLM, SGLang, and TRT-LLM).

Create or update your `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```
{
    "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
    "model": "local/nvidia-nemotron-3-super",
    "provider": {
        "local": {

            "name": "local_backend",
            "options": {
                "baseURL": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
                "apiKey": "EMPTY"
            },
            "models": {

                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },

        },
        "plan": {
            "temperature": 1.0,
            "top_p": 0.95,
            "max_tokens": 32000
        }
    }
}
```
Update `baseURL` to match whichever backend you are running. The default port above (`8000`) matches the vLLM example; SGLang and TRT-LLM use `30000` and `8123` respectively.

##  **Advanced: Budget-Controlled Reasoning**

Set a hard token ceiling on the reasoning trace using `reasoning_budget`. The model will attempt to close the trace at the next newline before the budget is hit; if none is found within 500 tokens it closes abruptly at `reasoning_budget + 500`.

```

    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        assert max_tokens > reasoning_budget, (
            f"reasoning_budget must be less than max_tokens. "
            f"Got {max_tokens=} and {reasoning_budget=}"
        )
        # Step 1: generate the reasoning trace up to the budget
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model=model, messages=messages, max_tokens=reasoning_budget, **kwargs
        )
        reasoning_content = response.choices[0].message.content
        if "" not in reasoning_content:

        reasoning_tokens_len = len(
            self.tokenizer.encode(reasoning_content, add_special_tokens=False)
        )
        remaining_tokens = max_tokens - reasoning_tokens_len
        assert remaining_tokens > 0, (
            f"No tokens remaining for response ({remaining_tokens=}). "
            "Increase max_tokens or lower reasoning_budget."
        )
        # Step 2: continue from the closed reasoning trace
        messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reasoning_content})
        prompt = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(

            "finish_reason": response.choices[0].finish_reason,
        }
```
**Example usage** (32-token reasoning budget):

```
client = ThinkingBudgetClient(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
    api_key="EMPTY",
    tokenizer_name_or_path="nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16",
)

        {"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"},
    ],
    reasoning_budget=32,
    max_tokens=512,
    temperature=1.0,
    top_p=0.95,
)
print(result)
```
The model has been integrated into 🤗 Transformers since v5.3.0. We recommend using the Nemotron 3 Super container from the NeMo Framework to ensure all required libraries are available.

```
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto"
)
```
If your Transformers version is lower than v5.3.0, please add `trust_remote_code=True` when loading the model:

```
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True
)
```
Please note that the model supports up to a 1M context size, although the default context size in the Hugging Face configuration is 256k due to higher VRAM requirements.

Here is an example of generating outputs with reasoning enabled (the default):

```
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about GPUs"},
]
tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
    return_tensors="pt"
).to(model.device)
if not isinstance(tokenized_chat, torch.Tensor):

NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16 is pre-trained on a large corpus of high-quality curated and synthetically-generated data. It is trained in the English language, as well as 19 other languages and 43 programming languages. Our sources cover a variety of document types such as: webpages, dialogue, articles, and other written materials. The corpus spans domains including legal, math, science, finance, and more. We also include a small portion of question-answering, and alignment style data to improve model accuracy. The model was trained for approximately 25 trillion tokens.

The post-training corpus for NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16 of high-quality curated and synthetically-generated data. Primary languages used for post-training include English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and Chinese.

These datasets, such as FinePDFs, EssentialWeb, HotpotQA, SQuAD, and HelpSteer3, do not collectively or exhaustively represent all demographic groups (and proportionally therein). For instance, these datasets do not contain explicit mentions of demographic classes such as age, gender, or ethnicity in 64-99% of samples, depending on the source. In the subset where such terms are present, document-based datasets (FinePDFs and EssentialWeb) contain representational skews, such as references to "male" outnumbering those to "female", and mentions of "White" as the most frequent among ethnic identifiers (comprising 43-44% of ethnicity mentions). To mitigate these imbalances, we recommend considering evaluation techniques such as bias audits, fine-tuning with demographically balanced datasets, and mitigation strategies like counterfactual data augmentation to align with the desired model behavior. This evaluation used a 3,000-sample subset per dataset, identified as the optimal threshold for maximizing embedder accuracy.

During post-training, we generate synthetic data by distilling trajectories, solutions, and translations from strong teacher models and agent systems, often grounded in real tasks or documents and aggressively filtered for quality. For math, code, and science, we start from curated problem sets and use open source permissive models such as GPT-OSS-120B to produce step-by-step reasoning traces, candidate solutions, best-of-n selection traces, and verified CUDA kernels. For long-context and science, we build synthetic QA and reasoning data by retrieving passages from long documents, generating MCQ/OpenQA questions and answers, and paraphrasing them into multiple prompt/response formats to ensure diversity. Across all pipelines we stack automated verification—compilers, numerical checks, language identification—to ensure our data is high quality.

For all domains, we apply a unified data filtering pipeline to ensure that only high-quality, license-compliant, and verifiable samples are used for post-training. We first discard malformed examples using structural checks (e.g., missing tool definitions when tool calls are present). We then aggressively filter reasoning traces exhibiting pathological repetition, such as repeated n-grams within a sliding window or across the entire trajectory, which we found to be a strong indicator of malformed or low-quality reasoning. Finally, based on internal audits of synthetically generated datasets, we observed that some teacher models occasionally produce reasoning traces and final responses that implicitly align with specific political entities or promote nationalistic narratives. To mitigate this, we apply targeted keyword- and regex-based filters and remove all trajectories matching such behavior.

Alongside the model, we release our final pre-training and post-training data, as outlined in this section. For ease of analysis, there is a sample set that is ungated. For all remaining code, math and multilingual data, gating and approval is required, and the dataset is permissively licensed for model training purposes.

More details on the datasets and synthetic data generation methods can be found in the technical report ***NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Super***.

The foundation of the model is trained on the **Nemotron-3-Nano** corpus, comprising the following collections:

| Dataset Collection | Token Counts | Description | 
|---|---|---|
| **Nemotron-CC-v2** &**v2.1** | 9.13T | A massive collection of English web data filtered from Common Crawl, including 2.5T+ tokens of new organic, translated, and synthetically rephrased content. | 
| **Nemotron-CC-Code-v1** | 427.9B | High-quality code tokens extracted from Common Crawl using the Lynx + LLM pipeline to preserve structure and equations. | 
| **Nemotron-Pretraining-Code-v1** &**v2** | 1.09T | Curated GitHub code references with multi-stage filtering, deduplication, and large-scale synthetic code data. | 
| **Nemotron-CC-Math-v1** | 133.3B | High-quality math pre-training dataset preserving LaTeX formatting and mathematical structures. | 
| **Nemotron-Pretraining-Specialized-v1** | 336.4B | Synthetic datasets targeting specialized domains such as STEM reasoning and scientific coding. | 

The English Common Crawl data was downloaded from the Common Crawl Foundation (see their FAQ for details on their crawling) and includes the snapshots CC-MAIN-2013-20 through CC-MAIN-2025-13. The data was subsequently deduplicated and filtered in various ways described in the Nemotron-CC paper. Additionally, we extracted data for fifteen languages from the following three Common Crawl snapshots: CC-MAIN-2024-51, CC-MAIN-2025-08, CC-MAIN-2025-18. The fifteen languages included were Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Thai. As we did not have reliable multilingual model-based quality classifiers available, we applied just heuristic filtering instead—similar to what we did for lower quality English data in the Nemotron-CC pipeline, but selectively removing some filters for some languages that did not work well. Deduplication was done in the same way as for Nemotron-CC.

The GitHub Crawl was collected using the GitHub REST API and the Amazon S3 API. Each crawl was operated in accordance with the rate limits set by its respective source, either GitHub or S3. We collect raw source code and subsequently remove any having a license which does not exist in our permissive-license set (for additional details, refer to the technical report).
